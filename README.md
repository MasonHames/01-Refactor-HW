Homework For GT Boot
Touched up and cleaned the code for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.
Replaced multiple <div> tags with proper markers for the layout of the page, intered alt text for images, condensed CSS code to not have repetitive actions in an attempt to cut down on bloat, and added a reset.css file incase anything fails.
